# react-boilerplate
My personal React boilerplate with TypeScript, webpack, SCSS module support and browser-sync.

## Why did I share this
I use this boilerplate for my personal and work projects. I kept it to a minimum to avoid any overhead.

I try to update the dependencies from time to time. I also added types for some common libraries I use quite often.

Since friends and colleagues ask me quite often how I start my projects, I thought it would be a nice idea to release this to the public.

## How to use

Simply clone this repo by using
```
  git clone <MyProject>
```
  
then move on to remove the .git folder and simply run
```
  git init
```
  
to initialize a new git repository.
